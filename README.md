# Introduction-to-Video-Data-Analysis-using-CNNs
Includes python code to kick start the analysis of video data ( containing both temporal and spatial features) using Convolutional Neural Networks.
Do we mere mortals understand just HOW important the screen time is for an actor?. It determines the pay they'll get so in other words it's their lifeline. To give you a glimpse of it's effect on the paygrade, did you know that Robert Downey Jr. Downey picked up $10 million for just 15 minutes of screen time in “Spider-Man Homecoming”?.

This project addresses the use of CNNs for the determining the screen time of any given actor/ character in a given video file. It will consequently help you understand how to use deep learning on video data. To do this, we will be working with a sample video from the popular TOM and JERRY show. The aim will be to calculate the screen time of both TOM and JERRY in any given video.

CAUTION: Due to small size of the video file (04:58 minutes), the accuracy with the CNNs might be a bit of a downer but the ultimate goal of the project will be accomplished nevertheless.
